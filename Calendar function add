Our current templates are rigid and hard to customize, especially for barbershop owners who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy. 
We need at least 2‚Äì3 beautiful, mobile-friendly templates that feel modern, fast, and trustworthy ‚Äî 
right out of the box. Most users will not customize them much, so visual polish and clarity matter more than flexibility.‚Äù

Strategic Options
        Option A: Build Templates in the Existing CodeIgniter Stack
        ‚úÖ Pros:
        
        Faster to deploy
        
        Keeps existing system intact
        
        ‚ùå Cons:
        
        Time spent on legacy tech
        
        Harder to scale or maintain
        
        Will require full rework later when moving to Laravel

Option B: Prioritize Laravel Upgrade, Then Build Templates
        ‚úÖ Pros:
        
        Cleaner architecture using Laravel Blade
        
        Easier for future developers to contribute
        
        Templates can plug into upcoming AI/queue/schedule features
        
        ‚ùå Cons:
        
        Slight delay in shipping templates
        
        Requires upfront dev effort

üéØ Recommendation
Communicate to your developer:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs prioritize the Laravel upgrade so we can future-proof the platform. 
Once the Blade framework is in place, I‚Äôd like to design at least 2‚Äì3 modern templates. 
These templates will act as the ‚Äòface‚Äô of each shop, so let‚Äôs make them beautiful, 
responsive, and easy to populate from our existing database schema.‚Äù

Recommended Calendar Architecture for TrimPilot

1. Shop Calendar (Global View)
        
        Purpose: Overview of all appointments, time blocks, and queue status across all workers.
        
        Access: Visible only to shop owners/admins.
        
        Use Cases:
        
        Quickly view who's available and when
        
        Block shop-wide hours (e.g., closed for holidays)
        
        Display a public ‚Äúshop queue‚Äù if needed

2. Individual Calendar (Per Worker)
        Purpose: Each barber manages their own availability.
        
        Access: Barber can log in and update their own schedule (and only theirs).
        
        Use Cases:
        
        Set personal working hours
        
        Block out vacation or lunch time
        
        View their own upcoming appointments


üß± Suggested Implementation Plan
        Phase 1: Create shop_calendar and worker_calendar tables (normalized by shop_id and user_id)
        
        Phase 2: Use FullCalendar.js or similar for the UI (can integrate into Laravel Blade templates)
        
        Phase 3: Sync with SMS reminders and queue visibility
        
        Phase 4: AI integration for smart recommendations and automated follow-ups

üîí Permissions Matrix
          Role	        View Shop Calendar	View Own Calendar	    Edit Shop Calendar	  Edit Own Calendar
          Owner/Admin  	     ‚úÖ	                   ‚úÖ	                 ‚úÖ	                    ‚úÖ
          Worker	           ‚ùå	                   ‚úÖ	                 ‚ùå	                    ‚úÖ
          Customer	         ‚ùå	                   ‚ùå	                 ‚ùå                   	‚ùå

          Customer should be able to see each barber's available spots and be able to pick one available time.

Database Table Schema ideas:

-- Shop Calendar Table
CREATE TABLE shop_calendar (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    shop_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    is_closed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (shop_id) REFERENCES shops(id)
);


-- Worker Calendar Table
CREATE TABLE worker_calendar (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    shop_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    is_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (shop_id) REFERENCES shops(id)
);
