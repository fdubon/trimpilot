## ðŸ§± Project Overview
TrimPilot is a startup reimagining barbershop operations with queue management, signage, and customer engagement tools. We have a working MVP written in raw PHP + MySQL and are now migrating it to a modern Laravel 10+ application.

Executive Summary
TrimPilot is an AI-powered platform designed to modernize barbershops by combining queue management, digital signage, and in-shop marketing into a single plug-and-play solution. Weâ€™ve built and validated a working MVP in raw PHP + MySQL, and weâ€™re now migrating to Laravel 10+ to improve scalability, maintainability, and development velocity as we prepare for live pilot deployments with barbershops in Southern California.

This document outlines the scope of the initial Laravel rebuild.
